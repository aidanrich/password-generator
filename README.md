# password-generator
## Description

- We needed a website which could help us generate strong passwords with a vareiety of options.
- By answering a series of prompts we are able to generate random passwords that fit possible password criteria.
- In this project we really challenged ourselves with javascript. We especially learned the use of 'if' statements and 'for' statements, as well as the usefullness of empty variable strings and arrays for holding data.
